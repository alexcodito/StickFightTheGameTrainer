# Stick Fight: The Game Trainer
A trainer / mod for Stick Fight: The Game that supports both local and online multiplayer modes (via steam).

Injecting IL code directly into the game's Assembly-CSharp.dll file allows this trainer to work accross all versions, including future updates. The intention is to have a maintenance-free trainer that does not need to reflect changes that are made in every update to the game. 

### Features

- HP Bars
- No Recoil
- Full Auto
- Scoreboard
- Flying Mode
- Skip Map/Boss
- Uncap Fire-rate

### Installation

Run the program and specify the path to your Stick Fight The Game installation folder.

### Controls
##### PC Keyboard

    - Toggle Trainer Menu: [SHIFT] + [M]
    - Skip Map: [SHIFT] + [S]
    - Spawn Random Weapon: [R]
    - Browse Weapons: [Q] for backwards or [E] for forward

##### Xbox 360 Controller

    - Toggle Trainer Menu: [Left Trigger Button] + [Right Trigger Button]
    - Skip Map: [RB] + [B]
    - Spawn Random Weapon: [RB]
    - Browse Weapons: [DPadLeft] or [DPadRight] while holding [RB]

### Notes

    - Quickly pressing and releasing the buttons simultaneously works best.
    - The scoreboard displays wins (i.e. how many rounds you wear the crown for).
    - When you skip a level the death doesn't actually count towards anyone's score.
    - This mod will only activate if you're playing locally or with other people that have it installed.
    - HP bars always display 100, even if your health is set to 300. Damage is scalled relatively.
