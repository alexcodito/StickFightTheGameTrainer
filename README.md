## Overview

Injecting IL code directly into the game's Assembly-CSharp.dll file allows this trainer to work accross all versions, including future updates. The intention is to have a maintenance-free trainer that does not need to reflect changes that are made to every update of the game. 

#### Features

- No recoil
- Full auto
- Scoreboard
- Flying mode
- Skip map/boss
- Display health
- Uncap fire-rate
- Unlimited health
- Unlimited ammunition
- Spawn weapon on demand (extra weapons)
- Browse and select weapons (extra weapons)
- Spawn different types of AI Bots (new Single Player mode)

Now supports playing online in Public Mode (cheats off), and with Modders-only Mode (cheats on).

## Project Building

The `Build Action` property is set to `None` for the following source code files.

- `/Trainer/TrainerLogic/Singleton.cs` (Generic singleton to allow reusing instances of TrainerManager and TrainerOptions)
- `/Trainer/TrainerLogic/TrainerManager.cs` (Contains most of the logic and UI)
- `/Trainer/TrainerLogic/TrainerOptions.cs` (Basic settings store)

These files are compiled at run-time during the trainer patching process using `System.CodeDom.Compiler.CodeDomProvider`. Several of the game's own reference DLLs are expected to be discovered in the 
same directory as the user-supplied target `Assembly-CSharp.dll` file, including `UnityEngine` and `TextMeshPro`. Important to note that the output binary is built with .NET Framework 3.5 to match the game's build.

Following successful compilation, the produced binary is immediately reloaded. Finally, the newly compiled `TypeDef`s are injected into the game's target `Assembly-CSharp.dll` file.

As a basic tampering prevention measure, the raw source files are encrypted with the use of AES 256, and are only momentarily decrypted at run-time for the aforementioned compilation step. 

A utility is available when the VS project is built in `Debug` mode to assist with this task. Pressing the `Dev. Options` button brings up the `Generate encrypted Logic Module sources & keys` option. 
This will load the three relevant `.cs` files and generate correspondingly named `.data` files, along with two additional files called `iv.data` and `key.data`.

Finally, the generated data must be *hard coded* within the `StickFightTheGameTrainer.Trainer.TrainerLogic.TrainerLogicModule` static class. While this is far from ideal,
it prevents script-kiddies from enabling cheats in online public lobbies.

Please note that when installing the patch in `Release` mode, the target assembly is additionally obfuscated with the use of ConfuserEx.

    - When you skip a level, no one wins the round.

    - HP bars always display 100, even if your health is set to 300. Damage is scaled relatively.
